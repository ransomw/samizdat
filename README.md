this repository is mostly an effort to avoid an analogue of
[Big Chief effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederacy_of_dunces)
wherein Tops Docket Gold pads clutter the floor.

the title is a David Foster Wallace reference, and
the image references both the DFW novel as well as
_Transmetropolitan_, a comic book series.
